# graveyard

## Rules

This is where I put all my projects that
- were never finished
- are now irrelevant (school exercises)
- I am ashamed of

## Exception

Projects that have reached a stable state and that I no longer maintain
or were discontinued will live on in their separate repositories.

This is only for the dead projects and shall be a reminder to always finish my projects!

## Organization

On branch for each old master branch of the old repository.

## Links

The idea and the scripts used for this repository are inspired by the [GitHub Spring Cleaning](http://kvz.io/blog/2014/02/21/how-to-deprecate-projects-on-github/) article.
