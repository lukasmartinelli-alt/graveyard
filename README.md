# graveyard

<img align="right" alt="graveyard" src="graveyard.png" />

Where my old projects go to die because they
- were never finished
- are now irrelevant (school exercises)
- contain code I am ashamed of

This container repo is only for the dead projects, 
Projects that have reached a stable state and that I no longer maintain
or were discontinued will live on in their separate repositories.
It contains one branch for each old master branch of the dead repository.

**Only projects that are older than a year are deleted on the GitHub parent repositories**.

## Projects

### [song-of-github](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/song-of-github)

**Description:** Generate audio signal from all live Github commits to showcase my GHRR project.

**Cause of Death:** Really difficult to generate sound that is pleasant to listen to.

### [rtpp](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/rtpp)

**Description:** Filter events from public stream and relay them to user webhooks.

**Cause of Death:** Would have been very interesting to implement but apart from that it is very difficult to understand what the idea is and I doubt anyone would use such a service.

### [redirekter](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/redirekter)

**Description:** Provide free HTTP redirects to other domains because on AWS one cannot create endless buckets for redirects.

**Cause of Death:** Etcd did not want to play along and killed the initial joy.

### [talentpool](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/talentpool)

**Description:** Manage and keep track of your Talent Pool of future employees

**Cause of Death:** Frontend and design actually finished. But never implemented a backend.

### [fs-googledrive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/fs-googledrive)

**Description:** Provides a PyFilesystem interface to Google Drive

**Cause of Death:** No longer motivated to work on implementation. Google Drive is quite difficult to emulate as a normal filesystem.

### [fs-dropbox](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/fs-dropbox)

**Description:** Simpler PyFilesystem implementation for Dropbox than the original

**Cause of Death:** The main project [cuckoodrive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/cuckoodrive) has been shut down.

### [syncany-android](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/syncany-android)

**Description:** Android Thin Client for Syncany.

**Cause of Death:** Only contained design and was meant for a study project I didn't get.

### [syncany-plugin-googledrive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/syncany-plugin-googledrive)

**Description:** Google Drive plugin for Syncany

**Cause of Death:** My second failed attempt at emulating Google Drive as a filesystem.

### [vss](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/vss)

**Description:** Markdown summary of the "Verteilte Software Systeme" lecture at HSR

**Cause of Death:** The summary has never been published and found it's way into a Google Document.

### [docker-flint](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/docker-flint)

**Description:**  Docker container to build flint.

**Cause of Death:** I cannot keep up with the flint releases that break each version.

### [flint](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/flint)

**Description:**  Dockerfile for Facebook's flint tool

**Cause of Death:** Facebook refused my pull request for an official flint repo.

### [mailgenic-web](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/mailgenic-web)

**Description:**  Website of my startup Mailgenic

**Cause of Death:** Mailgenic didn't solve a real problem and therefore failed.I could have tried harder though.

### [mailgenic-deploy](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/mailgenic-deploy)

**Description:**  Ansible deployment configuration my startup Mailgenic

**Cause of Death:** Mailgenic didn't solve a real problem and therefore failed.I could have tried harder though.
