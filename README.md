# graveyard

<img align="right" alt="graveyard" src="graveyard.png" />

Where my old projects because they
- were never finished
- are now irrelevant (school exercises)
- contain code I am ashamed of

This container repo is only for the dead projects, 
Projects that have reached a stable state and that I no longer maintain
or were discontinued will live on in their separate repositories.
It contains one branch for each old master branch of the dead repository.

## Projects

### [fs-googledrive](Provides a PyFilesystem interface to Google Drive)

**Description:** Provides a PyFilesystem interface to Google Drive

**Cause of Death:** No longer motivated to work on implementation. Google Drive is quite difficult to emulate as a normal filesystem.

### [fs-dropbox](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/fs-dropbox)

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------
|**Description:**    | Simpler PyFilesystem implementation for Dropbox than the original
|**Cause of Death:** | The main project [cuckoodrive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/cuckoodrive) has been shut down.

### [syncany-android](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/syncany-android)

**Description:** Android Thin Client for Syncany.

**Cause of Death:** Only contained design and was meant for a study project I didn't get.

### [syncany-plugin-googledrive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/syncany-plugin-googledrive)

**Description:** Google Drive plugin for Syncany

**Cause of Death:** My second failed attempt at emulating Google Drive as a filesystem.

### [vss](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/vss)

**Description:** Markdown summary of the "Verteilte Software Systeme" lecture at HSR

**Cause of Death:** The summary has never been published and found it's way into a Google Document.

### [flint](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/flint)

**Description:**  Dockerfile for Facebook's flint tool

**Cause of Death:** Facebook refused my pull request for an official flint repo.

### [docker-flint](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard/tree/docker-flint)

**Description:**  Docker container to build flint.

**Cause of Death:** I cannot keep up with the flint releases that break each version.

### [flint](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/flint)

**Description:**  Dockerfile for Facebook's flint tool

**Cause of Death:** Facebook refused my pull request for an official flint repo.
