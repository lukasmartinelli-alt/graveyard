Target group

Technical
But not much linux experience required

Goal:
Setup a mailserver in 10 minutes
you should choose a configuration in a web based configurator
this will output ansible variables
based on this ansible can provision a server

a script coordinates the different deployment environments
- linode
- aws
etc.

biggest problem points is probably all the DNS and Key stuff one has to do..


provide a security meter ... with different security options
tutorial for startcom certificate?

can I provide hosting for them?

webmails
mailpile or rainloop
